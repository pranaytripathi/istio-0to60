# Congratulations

Well-done on making it all the way to the end of the Istio 0 to 60 workshop!

In this workshop, you have covered a lot of ground!

Let's summarize.  You have:

- [x] Installed Istio
- [x] Deployed an application
- [x] Exposed the application to the internet (Ingress)
- [x] Deployed and studied observability addons including Kiali, Zipkin, Prometheus, and Grafana
- [x] Studied facets of service mesh security including mutual tls and authorization policies
- [x] Performed a traffic shifting exercise

Istio has many more features whose scope is beyond the 0 to 60 workshop, including but not limited to:

- [ ] failure injection
- [ ] circuit breakers
- [ ] extensibility with WASM
- [ ] egress gateways
- [ ] Istio deployment models

We encourage you to dig deeper into the [Istio docs](https://istio.io/latest/docs/) yourself.

You might also be interested in the free courses offered at the [Tetrate Academy](https://academy.tetrate.io/), including _Istio Funfamentals_, and _Envoy Fundamentals_.

Finally, if you're interested in certification, check out the [Istio Certified Administrator](https://academy.tetrate.io/courses/certified-istio-administrator) exam.

Thanks!
